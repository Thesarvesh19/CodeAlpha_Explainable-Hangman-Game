Explainable Hangman
Overview

Explainable Hangman is a behavior-aware word guessing game developed in Python.
Unlike traditional Hangman implementations, this project introduces explainability and player behavior analysis, transforming a simple game into an intelligent, educational experience.

The game not only determines win or loss but also analyzes how the player approaches guessing.

Key Features

Console-based Hangman game with a simple stick-man drawing

Randomized word selection for fair gameplay

Separate tracking of correct and incorrect guesses

Explainable game analysis report after completion

Psychological guessing pattern detection:

Vowel-focused guessing

Consonant-focused guessing

Balanced guessing strategy

Clean, exam-ready implementation with clear logic

What Makes This Project Unique

Most Hangman games stop at gameplay.
This project goes a step further by analyzing player behavior and generating an explainable summary of how the game was played.

It applies the idea of Explainable Systems to a classic game, making the logic transparent and learning-oriented rather than purely outcome-based.

Technologies Used

Python 3

Standard Python libraries (random)

Console input/output

No external dependencies are required.

How to Run

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system

Clone the repository

Run the program using:

python hangman.py


Follow on-screen instructions to play

Sample Game Analysis Output

Total guesses made

Number of correct guesses

Number of wrong guesses

Identified guessing style (vowel-focused, consonant-focused, or balanced)

Educational Value

This project demonstrates:

Control flow and loops

String and list operations

Input validation

Game state management

Basic behavioral analysis

Explainable output generation

It is suitable for academic submission, practical exams, and beginner-level project portfolios.
